## Why?

- Easily import real live site styles for a starting point for m
- Quicly turn real site components into design components
- Easy import from storybook, etc


## Limitations

Importing HTML layers to Figma is a best-effort process. Even getting 90% there can save you a ton of time, only having to clean up a few things. A few known limitations

- pseudoelements are not supported
- some CSS properties (e.g. overflow) are not supported or not fully supported
- not all types of images are supported (animated gifs, webp)
- resizing information is not generated
- all fonts have to be uploaded to Figma or a best effort fallback will be used
